## Case Study

Customers select and tell the cashier the food items and the cashier select the food items according to the customerâ€™s requirement. The cashier can add and remove the food items any time before ordering. Offers are also provided to the customer and offers are updated, and new offers are added when there are special occasions. The administrator of the system adds these offers. The added items by the customer will be displayed on the right side of the screen where the cashier can add or remove and see what they said and see the price of all the items and total price. Once the order is done, the system issues a bill with order details and the order number.
